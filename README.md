# Book-Search-Engine
## Description

A book search app made using the MERN stack. Users can make an account and login which allows them to save save a book they would like to purchase, as well as remove it from their library. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. Deploy the application to Heroku.
